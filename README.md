# @todo : 

# Improvements of the inital font :

- The omega middle bar height is to be taller.  
- The two rounds of the beta are to be inversed : the small one at the top, and the big one at the bottom.
- The bottom left bar of the alpha is to be straight rather than rounded, and its top bar is to be a little bit smaller.
